It provides a practical platform for users to experiment with and apply data compression principles effectively. This system allows for the efficient reduction of file sizes while maintaining data integrity.During the compression process, the system analyzes the input data, creating a Huffman tree based on the frequency of symbols (bytes) within the file. This tree is then used to map symbols to variable-length codes, achieving optimal compression. On the other hand, during decompression, the system employs the Huffman tree to reverse the process and recover the original data. In conclusion, this project offers critical tools for data compression and decompression, highlighting their pivotal role in information storage and transmission.",
